Placeholder for female avatar 1. This should be a real image.
Replace this text with actual image content or ensure the path points to a valid image.
If using placehold.co, the URL would be something like: https://placehold.co/256x256/E91E63/white.png?text=F1
However, as a static file, this needs to be an actual image.
For now, this is a text file acting as a placeholder.
This will likely result in a broken image icon in the UI until replaced.
To make it a valid (but tiny) png data URI for testing, you could use:
data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=
But since I must generate content, and I cannot generate binary, this text placeholder is what I'll create.
The actual image should be fetched from https://placehold.co/256x256/E91E63/white.png (example) and saved here.
The data-ai-hint for this type of image would be "female professional".
