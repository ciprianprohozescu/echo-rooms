## Core Features:

- AI Agent Simulation: Simulate AI agents with distinct roles (CTO, Finance, Product, HR) that respond to the user's proposals with relevant questions, concerns, and feedback. Use custom prompts to tailor agent behavior.
- Real-time Coaching: Implement an AI coaching tool that analyzes the user's responses in real time, assessing clarity, persuasiveness, and technical soundness, providing immediate feedback and suggestions for improvement.
- Virtual Meeting UI: Design a user interface to present a meeting scenario to the user. Collect textual responses to drive the simulation forward.
- Scenario Design: Create diverse meeting scenarios (product pitch, OKR review) with specific objectives for the user to achieve, challenging their communication and decision-making skills.
- Turn Orchestration: Implement a turn-based system to manage interactions between the user and the AI agents, ensuring a structured and engaging meeting simulation.
- Feedback Summary: Generate a summary report at the end of the simulation, highlighting the user's strengths and weaknesses, and providing actionable insights for skill development.
- Semantic Skill Evaluation: The product uses a 'tool' to assess the semantic quality of a user's response, and use its evaluation in deciding whether and when to present pre-determined content or guidance.
